# Ir3mind-Modular-based-device-to-curb-Myopia-habits
Modular Device that consist of a smell diffuser, smart lamp, speaker, LCD, that uses bluetoooth to connect to nano. A non intrusive, multi functional 'smart alarm' that engages one's senses. As compared to traditional alarm, our project aims to provide a subtle but escalating reminder system. By not having a buzzer straight-up alarm, proper reading habits no longer becomes a chore, but something we can look forward to.
